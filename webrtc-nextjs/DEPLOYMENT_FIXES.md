# WebRTC Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### Vercel Video Feed Issue:
The problem was that Vercel's serverless functions create new instances for each API call, causing in-memory data to be lost between signaling calls. 

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **Improved Signaling Storage**: Used global objects to persist data within the same serverless instance
2. **Extended Timeouts**: Increased session timeout from 5 to 10 minutes
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added retry mechanisms for ICE candidates and answers
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logs to debug connection issues
5. **Robust WebRTC Configuration**: Added more STUN/TURN servers and better connection handling

### Railway 502 Error Fix:
The 502 errors were due to server binding and health check issues.

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **Fixed Server Binding**: Changed hostname from 'localhost' to '0.0.0.0' for Railway
2. **Health Check Configuration**: Proper health endpoint at `/api/health`
3. **Restart Policy**: Set restart policy to "on_failure" instead of "never"
4. **Environment Variables**: Proper PORT configuration
5. **CORS Headers**: Added proper CORS handling for WebRTC

## Deployment Instructions:

### For Vercel:
1. Your project is already configured correctly
2. The signaling API uses improved in-memory storage
3. For production, consider upgrading to Vercel KV (Redis) for true persistence

### For Railway:
1. Make sure your Railway project uses the updated `railway.toml`
2. The server.js is configured to bind to `0.0.0.0:3000`
3. Health checks are configured at `/api/health`

## Testing the Fixes:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Push changes to trigger deployment
2. **Deploy to Railway**: Push changes to trigger deployment  
3. **Test Video Feed**:
   - Open phone page on mobile device
   - Start camera
   - Open browser page on desktop
   - Connect to phone
   - Video should now stream properly

## Key Improvements Made:

### Enhanced WebRTC Configuration:
- Added multiple STUN servers for better connectivity
- Added TURN servers with TCP fallback
- Improved ICE candidate handling with retry logic
- Better connection state management

### Better Camera Handling:
- Enhanced video constraints for better quality
- Proper error handling for different camera issues
- Detailed logging of camera settings

### Robust Signaling:
- Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Better session management
- Extended timeouts for slow connections
- Improved cleanup of expired data

## Monitoring:

Check the console logs for:
- `‚úÖ` Success messages
- `‚ùå` Error messages  
- `üì°` WebRTC signaling events
- `üßä` ICE candidate events
- `üìπ` Camera events

If you still experience issues, check:
1. Browser console for WebRTC errors
2. Network connectivity
3. Camera permissions
4. Firewall/NAT traversal issues
